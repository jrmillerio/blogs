<p> Today, the world economy is wider-reaching than ever before. The internet and wide adoption of English as an international language has driven a newfound interconnectedness between people. Individual networks are extremely widened and the amount of reach a single person has is the widest its been in history. What comes with this, is a new ability to share. Products, services, ideas and cultural heritage are all being passed around this global network extremely quickly, creating a new culture of sharing like never before. Technology has made it possible for this sharing culture to exist in many cultures in our lives, as people now "own" less than ever.
<p> I have always been a tech-oriented person, and I have a lot of appreciation for how this new sharing economy and culture is improving the lives of so many people. However, a central question I have with this is how much people are willing to share.
<p> My personal belief is that there is a central need for ownership in the lives of people today as a way to define them. Purchasing your first house was a central part of the building of peoples lives for the last 100 years. Owning an idea or patenting a product can lead to the creation of a business, which creates a legacy.
<p> Some other scenarios look like they might lead to the adoption and support of sharing models:
<p> -Silicon Valley is adopting the sharing idea for cars, services, and even smaller items like furniture.
<p> -Media is being constantly shared around the internet in the public domain, making many peoples work is no longer able to be owned because access to a larger audience only exists in online media.
<p> -As robotics and artificial intelligence continues to take hold in manufacturing, and the wealth gap continues to grow, it is inevitable that there is going to have to be some sort of redistribution of wealth.
<p> Things like this can be replaced, but introducing the sharing mindset to those that have a predisposition of ownership may be a problem. The central question that needs to be answered in many of these scenarios, is just how willing people are to share in each one fo these scenarios, and how it could be done in a way that would be supportive of those who want to continue partial ownership in many parts of their life.
<p> The viability of this in many industries is almost entirely dependent on this question, and getting an answer to this is critical to making the process in the transition away from ownership to support this growing and more interconnected population.
